serverComments=# The list of database servers to start using the 'cubrid service start' command.\r\n# This property is effective only when the above 'service' property contains 'server' keyword.
commonSectionComments=# Common section - properties for all databases\r\n# This section will be applied before other database specific sections.
autoRestartServerComments=# Restart the server process automatically
checkpointIntervalInMinsComments=# Checkpoint when the specified time has passed (minutes).\r\n# Checkpoint will be done also when the log has increased with the number of specified pages.
cubridPortIdComments=# TCP port id for the CUBRID programs (used by all clients).
dataBufferPagesComments=# Number of data buffer pages\r\n# data_buffer_pages (25,000 pages) * DB page size (4KB) = 100M
dataBufferSizeComments=# Size of data buffer use K, M, G, T unit
deadlockDetectionIntervalInSecsComments=# Interval between attempts at deadlock detection (seconds).\r\n# An approximate interval to attempt to run the deadlock detector.
isolationLevelComments=# Transaction isolation level.\r\n# Six levels of isolation are provided, represented by:\r\n# "TRAN_SERIALIZABLE"\r\n# "TRAN_REP_CLASS_REP_INSTANCE"\r\n# "TRAN_REP_CLASS_COMMIT_INSTANCE"\r\n# "TRAN_REP_CLASS_UNCOMMIT_INSTANCE"\r\n# "TRAN_COMMIT_CLASS_COMMIT_INSTANCE"\r\n# "TRAN_COMMIT_CLASS_UNCOMMIT_INSTANCE"\r\n# For other aliases, or for more information on the levels, see the\r\n# System Parameters chapter in the Database Administration Guide.
javaStoredProcedureComments=# Enable Java Stored Procedure
lockEscalationComments=# Maximum number of locks acquired on individual instances of a\r\n# class before the locks on the instances are escalated to a class lock
lockTimeoutInSecsComments=# Minimal amount of time to wait for a lock (seconds).\r\n# A negative value, indicates to wait indefinitely until the lock is\r\n# granted or until the transaction is rolled back as a result of a deadlock.\r\n# A value of 0, indicates not to wait for a lock.
logBufferPagesComments=# Number of log buffer pages.\r\n# log_buffer_pages (50 pages) * DB page size (4KB) = 200KB
logBufferSizeComments=# Size of log buffer use K, M, G, T unit
maxClientsComments=# The maximum number of concurrent client connections the server will accept.\r\n# This value also means the total # of concurrent transactions.
replicationComments=# Become a master server for replication.
sortBufferPagesComments=# Number of sort buffer pages\r\n# sort_buffer_pages (16 pages) * DB page size (4KB) * number of threads
sortBufferSizeComments=# Size of sort buffer are using K, M, G, T unit\r\n# The sort buffer should be allocated per thread.\r\n# So, the max size of the sort buffer is sort_buffer_size * max_clients.

backupVolumeMaxSizeBytesComments=# This parameter places an upper limit on the size in bytes of the backup volumes created with the backupdb utility.\r\n# This can be used to segment a backup into multiple backup volumes.\r\n# nIt should be set only when needed. When this parameter is not set or set to default(-1),\r\n# backup volumes will be as large as the destination media allows.
